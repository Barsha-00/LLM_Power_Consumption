# LLM_Power_Consumption

# Overview: 
Using a preprocessed dataset taken from the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset, this project carries out energy disaggregation (also known as non-intrusive load monitoring, or NILM). Utilising the llama-3.3-70b-versatile model through the Groq API platform, the project leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to address a variety of insightful dataset queries.
