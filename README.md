# LLM_Power_Consumption

Name : Barsha Sadhu

# Summary of the project: 
Using a preprocessed dataset taken from the "Individual household electric power consumption" dataset, this project carries out energy disaggregation (also known as non-intrusive load monitoring, or NILM). Utilising the llama-3.3-70b-versatile model through the Groq API platform, the project leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to address a variety of insightful dataset queries.

# Tasks Completed
Data Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Preprocessed raw power consumption data (household_power_consumption.csv)

Handled missing values, date-time parsing, and type conversions

Designed and issued intelligent queries for data analysis

Used LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) to generate Python code for query execution and data insight extraction
